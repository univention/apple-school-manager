<p>
	To set up synchronization with the Apple School Manager, please enter the Apple School Manager SFTP
	username and password in the
	<a href="https://docs.software-univention.de/app-provider.html#app-settings" target="_blank">App
	Settings</a>. For more information on how to obtain these credentials, please visit

<p>
	There are several ways to configure the Apple School Manager Connector.
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>
		<b>Regular Synchronization</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			You can select the daily synchronization in the App Settings.
		</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<b>Synchronization of schools</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			By default, a complete update of the user data takes place. Schools, classes, working groups
			and users (teachers and students) are synchronized.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, it is also possible to restrict the synchronization to individual schools. To do
			this, please go to Overview → School administration (Orange) → Schools → and select the
			school abbreviations of the schools you want to synchronize. Then switch to the App Settings
			of the Apple School Manager Connector and insert all school abbreviations of the schools you
			want to synchronize as comma seperated list.
		</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<b>Newly created users</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			If new users are created in the UCS IDM, they will be created during the next synchronization.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Attention</b>: If users were not created automatically, it is possible that the users did
			not have a valid mail domain in their mail address.
		</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<b>Deleting users </b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			If users are deleted in the UCS IDM, they will be deactivated during the next synchronization
			in the ASM and also deleted after 30 days.
		</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<b>Apple ID</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			Users are only synchronized if they have a valid primary mail address. This is used by
			default. It is possible to insert a prefix before the mail domain. If necessary, set the UCR
			variable <code>asm/attributes/user/email/prepend_domain</code> under Overview → System (Purple) → Univention Configuration Registry.
		</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<b>Passwords</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			Passwords must be distributed independently within the ASM.
		</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<b>Anonymization</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			If you want to activate anonymization, please set the following two UCR variables <code>asm/attributes/staff/anonymize</code> &amp; <code>asm/attributes/student/anonymize</code> under Overview → System (Purple) → Univention Configuration Registry. Afterwards only the username (uid) of the user synchronized.
		</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>
		<b>Class numbers</b>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			The synchronization of the class numbers can be deactivated with the UCR variable <code>asm/attributes/classes/class_number_empty</code> under Overview → System (Purple) → Univention Configuration Registry.
