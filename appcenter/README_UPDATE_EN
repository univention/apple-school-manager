		The course name was comprised of the school classes description before. Now the class name is
		used as the course name.
	</li>
	<li>
		LDAP filters for more control over the exported staff and students can now be defined with the
		UCR variables <code>asm/ldap_filter/students[/$OU]</code> and

	<li>
		Using the UCR variable <code>asm/attributes/student/password_policy</code> it is now possible to
		fill the <code>password_policy</code> CSV column for newly synchronized students. (A password
		policy for teachers is not supported by Apple.) The UCR value is the length of passwords created
		by Apple for <i>new</i> students. Allowed values are <code>4</code>, <code>6</code>,
		<code>8</code> and the dash (<code>-</code>). The dash means, that the default value configured
		in the Apple School Manager for a school will be used (will be written as empty field to CSV).
		Default: <code>4</code>.
